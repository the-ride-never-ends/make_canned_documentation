# 1. System Overview

## 1.1 High-Level Diagram

See mermaid graph in architecture_diagram.md

## 1.2 Core Responsibilities
1. Input Layer
- Handles multiple input methods (API, Terminal, File)
- Validates input against specifications
- Enforces size limits (4096 tokens)
- Performs preprocessing (character removal, normalization)

2. Processing Layer
- Manages LLM interactions (keeping within budget)
- Generates Core (P0) and Extended (P1) documentation
- Implements checkpoint system for recovery
- Handles versioning and changelog generation

3. Quality Layer
- Implements quality metrics (Purpose Alignment, Readability, etc.)
- Performs Flesch-Kincaid testing
- Validates against documentation requirements
- Ensures cross-document coherency

4. Storage Layer
- Manages document versioning
- Implements 5-minute autosave
- Handles caching for API cost optimization
- Provides backup/recovery mechanisms


## 1.3 Key Design Decisions
1. Layered Architecture
   - WHY: Separates concerns and allows for independent scaling
   - WHY: Matches a P0-P3 priority matrix (Source: README.md, Section 1.5.2 'Feature Priority Matrix')

2. Extensive Caching
   - WHY: Meets cost constraints ($0.50/document) (Source: README.md, Section 1.5.2 'Feature Priority Matrix')
   - WHY: Handles API rate limits and failures

3. Quality-First Pipeline
   - WHY: Meets high quality thresholds (85-95%) (Source: README.md, Section 1.5.2 'Feature Priority Matrix')
   - WHY: Enables section-by-section validation

4. Centralized Storage
   - WHY: Supports version control requirements (Source: README.md, Section 1.5.2 'Feature Priority Matrix')
   - WHY: Enables consistent backup/recovery

## 1.4 Essential Characteristics

## 1.5 Critical Paths

1. Document Generation
Input → Validation → Processing → Quality Check → Output
Target: < 5 minutes/doc
Bottleneck: LLM API calls
Recovery: Cached results

2. Quality Assurance
Generation → Metrics → Validation → Approval/Retry
Target: 85-95% quality score
Bottleneck: LLM evaluation
Recovery: LLM Generation Retry, Manual override
